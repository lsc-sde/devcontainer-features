[Dev Containers](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers) are a quick and convenient method for creating a reliable and consistent development environments with all the tools needed to get started. This can massively accelerate the speed at which a new developer can get setup.

For now there is only a single dev container configuration, however the intention long term is to setup a customised dev container specification using *krapctl*.
